# silo-airflow

[KIPP Chicago's](www.kippchicago.org) docker-based development environment for [Airflow](https://airflow.incubator.apache.org/) (via [Google Cloud Composer](https://cloud.google.com/composer/))

The aim is to allow local development of DAGs in an environment that most closely mimics Cloud Composer's Airflow implementation.
